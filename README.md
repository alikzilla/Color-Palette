# ColorPicker

This project is a simple color picker application developed using Vite, React, and TypeScript. It utilizes the `react-color-palette` library for creating the color picker interface and the `react-copy-to-clipboard` library for copying colors to the clipboard.

## Getting Started

To get started with the ColorPicker application, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (v14.x or higher)
- npm (v6.x or higher) or yarn (v1.22.x or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/colorpicker.git

   cd colorpicker
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   # or
   yarn
   ```

### Running the Application

Once the installation is complete, you can run the ColorPicker application with the following command:

```bash

```

This command starts the development server. You can now view the application by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.
